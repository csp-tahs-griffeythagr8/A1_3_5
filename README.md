# A1_3_4 Nested Branching and Input

*Don't forget to create your feature branch

## Before You Begin
1. Make a copy of A1_3_3
2. Place it into the A1_3_4 repository cloned to your computer. 
3. Rename the file to A1_3_4 YourLastName.
4. Update the docstring.

## Adding and Sanitizing User Input
Create a variable 'usr_input' that is assigned an input from a user statement. 

If necessary, check Part II from A 1.3.4 in the book to see how we use the input function. Make sure that you use input() and not raw_input() as we are working in Python 3.7.4. 

Enter the following code after your newly created variable to sanitize your data: 

```python3
try:
  sani_input = int(usr_input)
  print("Is an integer")
except(TypeError, ValueError):
  print("Not an integer")
```
